# Overview

This is a hunting reservation management system called SeleApp built for Cison di Val Marino. It's a full-stack web application that allows hunters to make reservations for hunting zones and administrators to manage wildlife quotas and track hunting activities.

The application uses a modern tech stack with Express.js backend, React frontend with TypeScript, PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM, and shadcn/ui components for the interface.
