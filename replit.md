# Overview

This is a hunting reservation management system called SeleApp built for Cison di Val Marino. It's a full-stack web application that allows hunters to make reservations for hunting zones and administrators to manage wildlife quotas and track hunting activities.

The application uses a modern tech stack with Express.js backend, React frontend with TypeScript, PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM, and shadcn/ui components for the interface.

## Reservation System
- Time-slot based reservations (morning/afternoon)
- Hunting day restrictions (no hunting on Tuesdays and Fridays)
- Conflict prevention for duplicate bookings
- Status tracking (active/completed/cancelled)

## Wildlife Quota Management
